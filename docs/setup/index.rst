Setup
=================================

FMDB (https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb), at the time of this writing, does
not suport Carthage. Look for yourself:

https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb/issues/324

So you will need to clone this Repo and the FMDB Repo and drag the FMDB
project into the Amigo Project to compile it.

Admittedly, we are probably not the best at the whole,
*"How do you share an Xcode Project"* thing, so any recommendations
to imporve this process are welcome.

Once you have it built, you can drop it into your own project(s)
and fire it up.
