Setup
=================================


Carthage
----------------------------------

FMDB (https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb),
as of v 2.6 FMDB, does suport Carthage.

Drop this into your :code:`Cartfile`:

::

    github "blitzagency/amigo-swift" ~> 0.2.0

Admittedly, we are probably not the best at the whole,
*"How do you share an Xcode Project"* thing, so any recommendations
to imporve this process are welcome.
